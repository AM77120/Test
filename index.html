        <p>The name "Reddit" is a play-on-words with the phrase "Read it", i.e., "I read it on Reddit." The site's content is divided into numerous categories, and 49 such categories, or "Default subreddits", are visible on the front page to new users and those who browse the site without logging in to an account.</p>
        <p>On February 14, 2013, Reddit began accepting the digital currency bitcoin for its Reddit Gold subscription service through a partnership with bitcoin payment processor Coinbase.</p>
        <p>On July 10, 2015, Pao resigned and was replaced by Steve Huffman as CEO. In October 2015, Reddit announced a news portal called Upvoted, designed to broaden the reach of Reddit as a standalone site featuring editorial content from Reddit users.</p>
        <p>On July 21, 2010, Reddit outsourced the Reddit search engine to Flaptor, who used its search product IndexTank.</p>

        <p>The donation spree broke previous records for the most money donated to a single cause by the Reddit community and resulted in an interview with Colbert on Reddit.</p>
        <p>In February 2013, Betabeat published a post that recognized the influx of multi-national corporations like Costco, Taco Bell, Subaru, and McDonald's posting branded content on Reddit that was made to appear as if it was original content from legitimate Reddit users.</p>
